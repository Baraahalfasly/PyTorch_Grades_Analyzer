Student Grades Analyzer using PyTorch is a program designed to analyze and evaluate students' academic performance using the powerful PyTorch library. The program collects students' grades in various subjects such as Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, and English, and then converts these grades into tensors for efficient processing. It calculates the average grade for each student and evaluates their performance based on this average according to specific criteria (such as Excellent, Very Good, Good, Pass, Fail). The results are displayed in a well-formatted table using the Tabulate library and are also saved in text and CSV files for easy access and review. This program enables teachers and administrators to accurately and systematically monitor students' performance, assisting in making appropriate educational decisions.
